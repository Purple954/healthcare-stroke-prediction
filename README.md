## Healthcare Stroke Prediction Model
# Overview
This project involves building a predictive model to classify whether a person has a stroke based on various healthcare and demographic factors. The dataset used is the Stroke Dataset, which includes various health metrics such as age, gender, smoking status, and medical history. The model is built using Random Forest Classifier and evaluated with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv, which contains various health-related attributes for each patient.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using healthcare data to predict stroke occurrence. The model achieves an accuracy score that helps assess its performance, and further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.
